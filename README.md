# Graph Traversal

In computer science, graph traversal refers to the process of visiting each vertex in a graph. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the vertices are visited. 

[More about Graph Traversal](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/graphs-and-its-traversal-algorithms)

procedure DFS(G, v) is
    label v as explored
    for all edges e in G.incidentEdges(v) do
        if edge e is unexplored then
            w ← G.adjacentVertex(v, e)
            if vertex w is unexplored then
                label e as a discovered edge
                recursively call DFS(G, w)
            else
               label e as a back edge
